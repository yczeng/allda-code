    "# Controlling the Vibration Motors\n",
    "These are several high-level functions that can be used to send commands to the Arduino and control the vibration motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino code has support for analog motor control (0-99 values of power, 0 being fully off and 99 being on at full power), but the motors used in the test setup are digital, i.e. they only have two states, off and on at full power. Therefore, two functions, *set_vibration_analog* and *set_vibration_digital* are provided to control different types of vibration motors, but the Arduino code should be able to handle both.\n",
    "\n",
    "*stop_vibration* is provided for convenience and just stops all vibration motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several high-level vibration sequences are provided through the *sequence_vibration* function, including:\n",
    "- **\"pulseall\"** - pulses all vibration motors simultaneously\n",
    "- **\"train\"** - does a sweep over all the vibration motors in order\n",
    "- **\"random\"** - produce random vibes, like a \"hum\" at shorter delays\n",
    "- **\"accel\"** - accelerate pulses from a slow rate to faster rate\n",
    "- **\"decel\"** - decelerate pulses from a fast rate to slower rate\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to initiate a sequence, call *sequence_vibration* with the name of the sequence (*seq*), delay between steps in the sequence (*delay*), and repetitions of the sequence (*reps*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can call the overloaded functions *play_{seq}* to play the corresponding sequence with given *delay* and *reps* parameters."
